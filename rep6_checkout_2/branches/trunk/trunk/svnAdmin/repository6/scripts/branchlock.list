# IMPORTANT!  Entries for locked branches must not have any leading or trailing spaces.
#             This is so the regexp in the validation script can accurately match only
#             the exact branchname and not have any false positives.
#             For example, "LATEST_ATREIDES" should not match "LATEST_ATREIDES_PROD",
#             so the regexp will look for "^LATEST_ATREIDES$".  Any leading/trailing
#             characters (including spaces) will break this.

# Locked permanently

# active branches - may need to restrict as circumstances dictate
